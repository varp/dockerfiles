Ubuntu/CentOS based development and applications running environments.

## base
Minimalistic base environment, based on Ubuntu/CentOS. In each version of the base distribution you will get enabled:
  - Locales support
  - BASH as default shell interpreter
  - Full set of APT/RPM utils.

The base layer is basically for non-interactive (without terminal and shell) use. This base layer is useful:
  - as a base for fast installing and running application in your own environments, because of enabled by default distribution's packages repositories. In CentOS out-of-box enabled: [Enterprise Linux Repo](https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/7/), which will give you access to the latest version and wide variety of software not available or not enabled by default. In Ubuntu out-of-box enabled: restricted, universe and multiverse repositories.
  - It's convenient to run locale dependent applications such as PostgreSQL (#1). First of all the application will use your locale in cases of data inputs, default collates and outputs it's 
  message and logs.
